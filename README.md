# Concealer
A Steganography application that allows you to hide the information inside an image without damaging the file and then 
retrieve the hidden information from the image. In case if it's needed, it is possible to completely remove the hidden information from the image
and restore the image to the default state.

*Steganography (/ˌstɛɡəˈnɒɡrəfi/ STEG-ə-NOG-rə-fee) is the practice of concealing a file, message, image, 
or video within another file, message, image, or video.*
